BA8640,Baker Shell Side Chair,Baker Furniture,Seating > Dining Chairs,4947,30%,3462.9,"Thomas Pheasant is drawn not just to classical design, but also to the many turns in its development. After the French Revolution, the curved back directoire chair spoke the language of popular optimism, reinvented itself with an elitist accent during the height of Art Deco luxury, and now draws runway whispers in a leaner and more modern rendition pushing the limits of the silhouette. The Shell refers to the back, with just enough curve and just enough pitch, enveloping the seat. Having reduced the form to its essence, the designer then adds a single rich detail-a cast Bronze ribbon pull with an organic texture and a polished interior. The Shell can work in a wide range of settings. More refined than modern, the Shell is proof that elegance and comfort need not compete. This form works at round, oval, and rectangular dining tables.
