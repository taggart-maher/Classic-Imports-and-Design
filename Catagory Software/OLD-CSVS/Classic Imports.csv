Fressinier was born in Cognac, France to scholarly portrait photographers who instilled in him an affinity for aesthetics. His artworks combine collage, impasto, abstraction and figurative painting to create a unique textural style that unites both classic and contemporary elements. He studied fine art at the École Brassart in Tours where he was exposed to the sketches and paintings of Rembrandt, Renoir, Courbet, Rubens, and Delaunay. Drawing inspiration from these masters, Fressinier has incorporated their classic sensibilities into his unique contemporary expression of femininity, forging his creative ground in the process.","GAL-3866-1, GAL-3866-2, GAL-3866-3, GAL-3866-4, GAL-3866-5, GAL-3866-6, GAL-3866-7",56,2,44

Born in California and trained as an architect, Michael Wilkinson started his artistic career in New York in 1979. In 1985, Wilkinson transitioned from working uniquely in bronze to working in the young medium of cast acrylic. A forerunner in the medium, Michael Wilkinson uses acrylic to create dreamlike worlds, communicating complex themes while still incorporating realism in his art. Unlike the traditional, these acrylic sculptures have no beginning and no end; no back and no front. They are viewed in a new way; studied and observed in their entirety from the inside and the outside. Working for nearly a decade in acrylic, Michael Wilkinson constantly expands his talents to sculpt ""light"" in original ways.","GAL-7828-1, GAL-7828-2, GAL-7828-3, GAL-7828-4, GAL-7828-5",20,6,19

The paintings of Douglas Hofmann are critically acclaimed for their glowing surfaces, detail and softly lighted forms. Hofmann expertly combines his own methods of painting with Old Master techniques, creating a beautiful aura of light and atmosphere that is more often found in great Baroque paintings. He pays a meticulous amount of attention to detail and creates harmonious compositions with superbly balanced colors and shapes. Through his burgeoning interest in the Old Masters, Hofmann has developed his individual technique.

Douglas Hofmann was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1945 and began his training in art after high school at the Maryland Institute of Art. During his first year there he discovered Joseph Sheppard who would be significant mentor and influence throughout his career. He began studying with Sheppard, taking on anatomy, drawing and painting from the model, all of which were new to Hofmann. There he also discovered the Maroger method, which enables the artist to use thin layers of paint and techniques similar to those of the Old Masters. Through his burgeoning interest in the Old Masters, Hofmann began to develop his individual taste. Emulating Vermeer, he painted situations from his home and studio using his wife and children as his models. Hofmann later expanded his subject matter to include his memorable nudes and his much-loved ballet works. Though his subjects have changed over the years, women have always dominated his panels and prints.","GAL-4360-1, GAL-4360-2, GAL-4360-3, GAL-4360-4",33,2.5,39
