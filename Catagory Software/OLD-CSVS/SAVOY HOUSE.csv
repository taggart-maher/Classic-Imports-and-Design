The delightful Rosendal gives your home a traditional chandelier form, reimagined with contemporary style. Designed by Brian Thomas, this dynamic chandelier has bold lines and graceful curves for a beautiful and elegant appearance. One large, open oval serves as the central column, and each of the six light arms is a rectangular bar that sweeps down into a scroll-shaped tail. A grand crystal drop hangs from both the top of the oval, and from the finial —and the entire fame has an exquisite, silver sparkle finish. Each of the six light arms holds a 60W, C-style bulb, surrounded by its own drum shade made of gorgeous Champagne fabric. It’s a wonderful fixture, with a luxury aesthetic and a touch of whimsy.","1-250-6-307-1, 1-250-6-307-2, 1-250-6-307-3, 1-250-6-307-4, 1-250-6-307-5, 1-250-6-307-6",30,30,25.5
