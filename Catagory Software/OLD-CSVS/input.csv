PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
Taking a chapter from the pages of fashion, we gave our signature Topaz Transitional Leaf finish an ombre effect. It takes on a deep color cast at the bottom and gradually becomes lighter at the top. We love the custom designed ginkgo leaf hardware pulls which are tributes to tastefully blending beautiful things. As you open the drawers, we hope you will be impressed with the linen-like damask pattern that decorates the drawer bottom. All the special nuances of French Connection make it a special signature piece for Caracole.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
Here is our 21st century interpretation of a klismos design that mixes metal, wood and leather into a highly versatile side chair. A seamless Golden Bronze metal tubular design creates the frame for the seat of the chair. Two thin, wide solid metal legs, along with a rear metal plate, form a truly sculptural base. Classic dark leather strapping around the seat deck provides the base upon which a plush dark espresso chenille cushion sits. Suspended from its metal frame is the winged outer back of the chair in fumed figured eucalyptus wood, finished to a high sheen in Aged Bourbon. A matching back cushion in the same espresso chenille completes this look that is at once retro and remade.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
Designer Jose Leite de Castro began designing furniture for his client's homes when he couldn't find pieces in the marketplace that fulfilled his vision. Such is the case with the Divergent Chest, a narrow piece designed for the essential, yet hard to find, mid-range height. Its thoughtful dimensions encourage the eye to travel around the room and explore instead of resting only on the tallest and shortest pieces. This Ebony Macassar Cabinet is intricately inlayed with French Brass in an enchanting pattern that wraps around the cabinet like a true work of art. Open its doors to see how the hinges are integrated into the brass inlay design. Perched atop an airy open-leg base and finished in Black lacquer, this is a statement piece that will elevate the style of any room. The designer recommends using this smart cabinet in pairs to add symmetry to a space.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
Soft flowing lines are a signature characteristic of the designer who created this bed. She likes to sketch each piece then set it aside, she revisits her work and adds a new line or changes a shape. It is a process of constant revision and tweaking. She considers how a design will compliment other pieces in the room but also have a voice of its own. The gentle curves and petite wings of the headboard are mirrored in the flowing lines of the side rails and footboard. The bedroom is about soothing and relaxation. She wanted to feel visual softness in the design.
